# Contributing
All the essential API logic for the project can be found under the `api`
directory and is written in Kotlin. [Ktor](https://ktor.io) is used for HTTP
handling.

The code for the web app will be kept inside the `web` directory and written
using Typescript and Vue.js.

Before you contribute, we ask that you have a working knowledge of HTTP services
and the languages we are using to facilitate such communications in this project
(Kotlin & Typescript). We also ask that you respect our users, employees and
fellow contributors when contributing to our software.
